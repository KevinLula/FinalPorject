The final project
DESCRIPTION and WORKING FEATURES
Our project creates sudoku puzzles for the user to interact with.Theres a whole variety of them, and the user can choose difficulty, and even the seed to try to solve the same puzzle again. There is also a timer that shows how long the user has been working on the the sudoku problem, and if the give up, they can either create a new puzzle aor check the solution. 
UNRESOLVED BUGS
We wanted to create a "Check" button that would check each individual inputted number but could not figure it out
HOW TO COMPILE
GO to the Final folder and from there compile the file SettingsGUI3.java
HOW TO USE IT
When you run SettingsGUI3, a window will pop up. From there you can click on Easy, Medium, or Hard to create a random sudoku puzzle with the corresponding difficulty. Another option is submit a seed(integer) and type the difficulty you want(case sensitive) and click create.
